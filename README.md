# Basic Requirement 
I want a customer to register. If the customer is more than 18 years of age I accept them as customers in my bank and send them a welcome email. If not I reject them and show them an error. This basic small but real life scenario helps illustrate how regular code is different from the one we would typically write if we use Test First / TDD based approach.
